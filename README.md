About Rackspace VMware Server Virtualization Solution Guide

Rackspace Server Virtualization is a managed VMwareÂ® vSphere environment that enables you to offload the maintenance and monitoring of the infrastructure, VMware stack, and guest operating system layer to a Rackspace Technology team of VMware Certified Professionals who are experts in storage, networking, and infrastructure.

Rackspace VMware Server Virtualization runs on VMware vSphere, which allows you to consolidate the hardware requirements for higher capacity utilization and benefit from greater efficiency. You can also take advantage of features not available in traditional environments such as snapshots, vMotion and Storage vMotion, quicker workload provisioning, and less impactful hardware maintenance processes.
