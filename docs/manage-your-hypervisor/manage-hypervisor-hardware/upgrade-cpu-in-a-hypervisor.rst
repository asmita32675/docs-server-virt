Upgrade CPU in a hypervisor
===========================

You can swap out the processor on your hypervisor to add more
CPU resources, which can enhance system performance. Adding CPU
resources results in increased costs for each hypervisor and
Guest OS licensing. When you add CPU resources to a hypervisor,
you must also add CPU resources to all hypervisors in the cluster,
if applicable.

To add CPU resources to your hypervisor, contact your Rackspace Technology
account team. We undertake this work in a planned maintenance window.
