Add RAM to a hypervisor
=======================


You can add RAM to your hypervisor, which can enhance system performance.
Adding RAM results in increased cost for each hypervisor. When you add
RAM to a hypervisor, you must also add RAM to all hypervisors in
the cluster, if applicable.

To add RAM to your hypervisor, contact your Rackspace Technology
account team. We undertake this work in a planned maintenance window.
