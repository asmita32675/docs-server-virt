Manage hypervisor hardware
==========================

If required, we can add RAM and CPU resources to your hypervisor based
on your business requirements. As your business grows and you add
applications, your hypervisor might require additional RAM and CPU.
In addition, we can perform routine maintenance on the hypervisor chassis.

This section includes the following topics:

- :ref:`Migrate to a new hypervisor chassis <migrate-to-a-new-hypervisor-chassis>`
- :ref:`Request hypervisor hardware maintenance <request-hypervisor-hardware-maintenance>`
