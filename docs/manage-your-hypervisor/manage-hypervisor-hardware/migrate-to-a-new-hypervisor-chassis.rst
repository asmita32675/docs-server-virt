Migrate to a new hypervisor chassis
===================================


Subject to compatibility, terms, and cost, we can migrate your environment
to a different Hypervisor chassis. You might need to migrate to
a new chassis to run the latest version of ESXi, support the most
recent driver, or when the current chassis has reached end-of-support.

Depending on the impact to your environment, we can migrate your chassis
during a planned maintenance window or as an emergency change. If your
hypervisor belongs to a cluster, you must migrate all hypervisors in the
cluster to a new chassis.

To migrate your hypervisor to a new chassis, contact your
Rackspace Technology account team.
