Shrink hypervisor storage
=========================

We cannot shrink LUNs, datastores, RDMs, local RAID disks, or vDisks.
However, we might be able to help you migrate your environment to
smaller datastores, LUNs, or vDisks.

If you are underutilizing space and want to downsize
(this is an uncommon requirement), contact your Rackspace Technology
account team and provide the following information:

•	The smaller size of storage you want
•	The name of the VM you want us to migrate
