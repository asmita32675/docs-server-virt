=====================
Expand VMFS datastore
=====================

When we expand a LUN :ref:`expand-luns`, we must also expand the VMFS
datastore. You can use the additional space to expand or add vDisks.

If your datastore was previously over-allocated before the expansion,
then the amount of useable new space might be less than you expect.
For more information about datastore overhead requirements,
refer to Datastore overhead requirements
:ref:`datastore-overhead-requirements`.

If you want us to expand a VMFS datastore, open a Rackspace Technology
ticket and provide the datastore name and the amount by which you want 
to expand it.
