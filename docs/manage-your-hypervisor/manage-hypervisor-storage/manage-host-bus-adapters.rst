Manage host bus adapters
========================


A host bus adapter (HBA) is hardware that you need for fiber channel
storage, such as shared SAN and dedicated SAN.

If you currently only have standalone hypervisors with local storage
and want to use SAN, we can install HBAs in each of your hypervisors.
Installing HBAs comes at an additional cost, and we install them during
a maintenance window.

To add an HBA, contact your Rackspace Technology account team and identify
the hypervisors for which you want us to add or remove HBAs. We usually
perform this work in a planned maintenance window.
