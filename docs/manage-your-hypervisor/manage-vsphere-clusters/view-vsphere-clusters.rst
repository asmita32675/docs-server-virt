View vSphere clusters
=====================



You can use the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal to see the ESXi
hosts that form a part of a vSphere cluster. If you have multiple
vSphere clusters, you can see all of the clusters. Understanding the 
ESXi hosts that comprise a vSphere cluster is useful when you ask us
to make changes to multiple ESXi hosts. Instead of providing us with
he names of all hosts in the cluster, you can simply give us
the vSphere cluster name.

To see vSphere clusters and members:

1. Log in to the `Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <https://login.rackspace.com/>`_.
2. In the Products drop-down menu, select **VMware Server Virtualization**.
3. Click the Clusters tab.
4. Click the cluster name to see the details.

The number of cluster members (hypervisors) displays in
the **Details** section. Cluster members are listed by name
in **CPU allocation** and **Memory** sections.
