Configure the distributed resource scheduler
============================================


Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) monitors the workload between
hypervisors and you can configure them to automatically move VMs
between ESXi hosts to address any imbalance.

For more information about DRS, refer to
:ref:`understanding-vmware-vsphere-clusters`.

To configure or modify DRS, open a Rackspace Technology ticket
and specify the DRS action you want us to take, including:

* Enable or disable DRS.
* Configure the DRS mode.
* Configure the DRS threshold.
* Configure DRS rules and groups.
* Configure VM overrides for DRS.
