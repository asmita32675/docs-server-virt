Manage vSphere clusters
=======================

Members of a vSphere cluster, a collection of ESXi hypervisors,
pool their resources with a single VM drawing resources from one
hypervisor at a time. All cluster members have either identical,
or in some cases similar, configurations.

This chapter includes the following topics:

- :ref:`View vSphere clusters <view-vsphere-clusters>`
- :ref:`Configure the distributed resource scheduler <configure-the-distributed-resource-scheduler>`
- :ref:`Configure high availability <configure-high-availability>`
- :ref:`Distributed power management <distributed-power-management>`
- :ref:`Add a resource pool <add-a-resource-pool>`
