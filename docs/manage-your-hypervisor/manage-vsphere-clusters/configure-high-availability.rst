===========================
Configure high availability
===========================





VMware vSphereÂ® High Availability monitors the ESXi host status, and
when a host fails, the vSphere HA feature automatically restarts
the VMs on remaining hosts.

To configure or modify high availability, open a Rackspace Technology
ticket and specify the HA action you want us to take, including:

* Enable or disable HA and include the cluster name.
* Set up VM overrides for HA

.. note::
    Provide us with the VM name and the HA override setting
    you want to apply to the VM.
