====================
Upgrade ESXi version
====================

We offer major ESXi version upgrades for your ESXi hosts and minor
patches, such as bug fixes and security updates. Depending on your
configuration, upgrading your ESXi host might require downtime for
some VMs. The upgrade might also negatively impact VM performance.
Because system performance can be negatively impacted, we usually
upgrade ESXi hosts during a planned maintenance window.

.. note::
    Because we test ESXi releases internally and make
    updates to our automation and infrastructure, we might not offer
    the latest major ESXi release until we complete testing with our
    infrastructure.

To upgrade your ESXi version, open a Rackspace Technology ticket and
request an upgrade. If your environment is eligible for an automated
upgrade, we contact you via a ticket and proceed with the upgrade.

If your ESXi version is close to or beyond the end-of-support date,
we open a ticket and notify you that you should upgrade.
If you do not respond to that ticket, and if your environment is
eligible to be updated without shutting down VMs, we inform you of
our plan and perform the upgrade.
