Plan hypervisor capacity
========================

As your business grows and you add to or expand your VMs, you might need
to add or upgrade your ESXi hypervisors to meet demand.

To plan for ESXi capacity, consider the following questions:

* Does the environment run well, or do you need additional
  physical resources to keep up with demand from the VMs?
* What would happen if a hypervisor goes down?
* What would happen if a hypervisor undergoes maintenance?

- :ref:`View hypervisor configurations <view-hypervisor-configurations>`
