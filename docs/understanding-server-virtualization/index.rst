Understanding server virtualization
===================================

A virtual server runs inside a virtual machine (VM) instead of a physical
machine. In VMs, the operating system (OS) layer does not link directly
to the physical hardware layer. Instead, there is a layer between the OS
and the physical layer, called a virtualization layer. A virtualization
layer is sometimes known as an abstraction layer because it abstracts
hardware from the OS.

You can run multiple VMs on a single server chassis. This configuration
provides many benefits, including cost-effectiveness due to consolidation,
less machine down-time, better resiliency, extra features such as snapshots,
and easier migration and upgrades.
