Understanding VMware vCenter
============================

VMware vCenterÂ® is a centralized server that Rackspace Technology
uses to manage your VM environment.

Rackspace Technology Support uses the VMware vCenter user interface
to connect to and manage your ESXi hosts. The Rackspace VMware Server
Virtualization offering does not provide you access to VMware vCenter
or a vSphere Client. If you require access to VMware vCenter, you can 
consider the VMware Server Virtualization Isolated vCenter deployment 
model.
