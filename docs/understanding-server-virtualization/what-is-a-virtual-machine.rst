What is a virtual machine?
==========================

A VM is software that mimics the behavior of a stand-alone computer.
You can use a VM to:

* Install an operating system
* Install and run applications

Instead of physical hardware, a VM uses virtual hardware such as
virtual CPU (vCPU), virtual RAM (vRAM), virtual network interface card
(vNIC), and virtual disks (vDisk) to complete operations. Because a
single physical device can include multiple VMs, using VMs helps you to
optimize hardware resources.
