Understanding VM replication
============================

VM Replication Enhanced Edition, powered by the Zerto® IT
Resilience Platform™, delivers a fully managed always-on experience.
With Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs)
measured in seconds and minutes, VM replication provides near-continuous
storage-agnostic data replication enabling the recovery of VMs from
business-impacting events such as ransomware, hardware failures,
or natural disasters. VM Replication offers both local and
remote replication.

.. note:: 

  You cannot configure VMs that have one of the following
  characteristics for a source VM:

    * Active Directory VMs (We support and recommend Active Directory
      native replication.)
    * VMs with raw device mappings (RDMs).
    * Multi-write disk mode.
    * Oracle clusters.
    * RHEL clusters.
