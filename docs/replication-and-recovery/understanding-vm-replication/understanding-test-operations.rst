Understanding test operations
=============================


You can replace the VM value in the VPG name with a customer-defined name.
Defining the appendix helps you identify the contents of the VPG.

For example, if you group VMs by customers, use the customer name or ID.
If you group VMs by application or workload, use a descriptor, such
as ProdCRM, to represent your Production CRM application.

* **Journal history days:** The target length of time you can roll back VMs
  within a VPG upon recovery.

  By default, each VM has a value of seven days. Setting the Zerto Journal
  History to seven days provides the ability to specify a recovery
  point-in-time within the last seven days.

  For example, if you accidentally decommission the wrong VMs and need to
  recover the VMs, but it takes you five days to identify the mistake,
  you can select the checkpoint before the decommission because you have
  a seven-day journal full of checkpoints.

  **Note:** The actual journal history size depends on the available
  storage. Configuring longer journal history requires the storage
  capacity to keep all changes for the desired period. The configured
  target might not be met and journal checkpoints that have not met
  the desired journal history target might be automatically deleted
  if there is insufficient space.

* **Boot order:** The order in which the VMs contained within a VPG boot upon recovery. VMs boot in ascending order.

  For example, if the VPG includes a database, application tier,
  and web server tier and the database must be available before
  the application tier or web server, you can set the database boot order
  to 1, application tier to 2, and web server to 3.

* **Use bubble network:** If the VMs are configured to use a
  bubble network, you can’t access them. However, we verify via console
  if the OS has booted up successfully. A bubble network is an isolated
  network which isn’t connected to any other network.

During the test, the source site continues to run normally, and any
changes you make on the target site are discarded at the end of the test.
If you prefer to shut down the source VMs and run the VMs on the secondary
site, consider a planned failover instead.
