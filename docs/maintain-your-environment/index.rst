Maintain your environment
=========================



To reduce the risk of certain change requests, Rackspace Technology or
customers can recommend that certain functions occur in a scheduled
maintenance. These scheduled maintenances ensure that the following 
are available to the customer:

* Reserved Rackspace Technology resources to complete the defined
  tasks of the maintenance.
* Documented maintenance preparation and quality checks from all
  departments involved in the maintenance.
* Defined length of maintenance to accomplish the defined tasks.
* Documented rollback plan in the event of unforeseen circumstances
  during execution.

Because we cannot confirm the full scope of a maintenance until we
completeall quality checks, Rackspace Technology schedules only after all
quality checks have passed.

Because we base the maintenance calendar scheduling on availability
of all teams involved, we accept reservations on a first-come,
first-served basis. However, if this maintenance is urgent or if
there is a limited timeline in which to execute it, contact your
account team to see if we can accommodate your need.
