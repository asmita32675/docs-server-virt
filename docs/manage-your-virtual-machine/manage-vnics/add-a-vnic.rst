==========
Add a vNIC
==========

If required by your software application, you can add a vNIC to a VM.

You cannot add a vNIC yourself. You must create a ticket and request that
we add the vNIC for you.

To add a vNIC, create a Rackspace Technology ticket that includes the
following information:

* The name of the VM.
* The port group name to which the vNIC should connect.
  
Unless you specify otherwise, we configure the vNIC as a VMXNET3 interface.
For more information about vNIC types, refer to :ref:`understanding-vnics`.
