Manage vNICs
============

VMs typically include the following two virtual network interface
cards:ref:`understanding-vnics`.

* **Public interface:** The public interface vNIC is the primary connection.
* **Dedicated backup network interface:** If you subscribe to

the Rackspace Technology managed backup service, the dedicated backup
network vNIC is used for file backup traffic.

While you cannot manage a vNIC yourself, we provide a list of information
for the following tasks that you should include in your ticket so that we
can expedite your request.

This section includes the following topics:

- :ref:`Add a vNIC <add-a-vnic>`
- :ref:`Remove a vNIC <remove-a-vnic>`
- :ref:`Change the association between a vNIC a port group <change-the-association-between-a-vnic-a-port-group>`
- :ref:`Change vNIC type <change-vnic-type>`
- :ref:`Connect or disconnect a vNIC <connect-or-disconnect-a-vnic>`
