=============
Remove a vNIC
=============

When you no longer need a vNIC that you have added (for example, if you
have uninstalled the application that requires the vNIC), you can request
that we remove it.

.. note:: 
    Do not request that we remove either of the default vNICs.
    If either of the default vNICs is removed, you lose access to your VM,
    and any backups might stop working.

To remove a vNIC, create a Rackspace Technology ticket that includes
the following information:

* The VM to which the vNIC connects.
* The name of the vNIC you want removed.
