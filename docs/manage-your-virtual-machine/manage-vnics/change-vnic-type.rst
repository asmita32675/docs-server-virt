Change vNIC type
================

Your VM might be compatible with multiple types of vNICs. By default,
your VM includes a VMXNET3 vNIC. If your software application requires,
you can change the vNIC to an E1000, E1000E, or VMXNET2 vNIC.

You cannot change the vNIC type yourself. To change the vNIC type,
create a Rackspace Technology ticket that includes the following
information:

* The name of the VM and the vNIC you want to change.
* The type of vNIC you want to use.
