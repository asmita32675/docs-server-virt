Change the association between a vNIC a port group
==================================================



To connect a virtual network card to a different network segment, you can
request that we change the association between a vNIC and a port group.
Refer to :ref:`understanding-port-groups` for more information about port
groups.

You cannot change the association between a vNIC and port group yourself.
You must create a ticket and request that we change the association
for you.

To change the association between a vNIC and a port group, create a
Rackspace Technology ticket that includes the following information:

* The name of the VM and the vNIC you want to change.
* The name of the port group to which you want to associate the vNIC.
   
.. note:: 
    When changing the association between a vNIC and a port group,
    we must change IPs, which can result in downtime.
