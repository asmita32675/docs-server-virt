============
Expand vDisk
============

If your environment runs low on free space or you anticipate growth,
you can request that we expand a vDisk.

Before you request that we expand a vDisk, view your
hypervisor configurations [link] to ensure that the datastore on which
the vDisk resides has sufficient free space for expansion, excluding
reservation. If required, we can migrate the vDisk to a datastore that
provides more space. For more information about migrating to a datastore,
refer to Move a VM to a datastore [link] by using storage vMotion.

To expand a vDisk, create a Rackspace Technology ticket that includes the
following information:

* The name of the VM
* The vDisk number
* The current vDisk size and the amount of space you want to add
* If Rackspace Technology manages the OS, include the drive letter or partition.
