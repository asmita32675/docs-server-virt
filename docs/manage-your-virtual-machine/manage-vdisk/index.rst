============
Manage vDisk
============

A vDisk is a virtual disk that the Guest OS uses for storage as it would
use a physical disk. A vDisk is represented as a ``.vmdk`` file on a VMFS
datastore.

While you cannot manage a vDisk yourself, we provide a list of information
for the following tasks, which you should include in your ticket so that
we can expedite your request.

This section includes the following topics:

- :ref:`Add vDisk <add-vdisk>`
- :ref:`Delete vDisk <delete-vdisk>`
- :ref:`Detach vDisk <detach-vdisk>`
- :ref:`Expand vDisk <expand-vdisk>`
- :ref:`Shrink vDisk <shrink-vdisk>`
