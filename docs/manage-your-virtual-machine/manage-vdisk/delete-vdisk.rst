============
Delete vDisk
============


Deleting a vDisk results in permanent data loss and is irreversible.
Because you cannot delete a vDisk, you must create a ticket and request
that we delete the vDisk for you.

Before you request that we delete a vDisk, ensure that the OS volume
on the vDisk is offline.

To delete a vDisk from your VM, create a Rackspace Technology ticket
that includes the following information:

* The name of the VM
* The vDisk number
* The vDisk size.
* The name of the datastore.
* If Rackspace Technology manages the OS, include the drive letter or partition.
