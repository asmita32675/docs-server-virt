Manage your virtual machine
===========================

Managing your VM includes provisioning VMs, deleting VMs, and
making changes to your VMs.

While you can use the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal to
complete many VM management tasks, there are some tasks that we
must perform for you. Weâ€™ve included step-by-step instructions
for all tasks that you can perform. For tasks that you cannot
complete, we provide a list of the information you should include
in your ticket so that we can expedite your request.
