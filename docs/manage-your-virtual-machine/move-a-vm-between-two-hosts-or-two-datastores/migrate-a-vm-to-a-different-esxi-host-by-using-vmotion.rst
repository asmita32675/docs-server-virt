Migrate a VM to a different ESXi host by using vMotion
======================================================

You might need to migrate a VM to a different ESXi host. This migration
process is called vMotion.

Request a vMotion when you want to:

* Migrate a VM to a new ESXi host.
* Migrate a VM from one vSphere cluster to another vSphere cluster.
  
The following diagram illustrates a VM migration process between two
ESXi hosts in a cluster.

**Important:**

* DRS might already be balancing VM placement within the cluster based on
  host workload and DRS rules. If DRS automatically balances VM placement,
  do not request a vMotion.
* If you vMotion a VM to another ESXi host when you have DRS in place,
  you might reverse the vMotion migration or trigger a series of
  subsequent vMotions.
* If you think that the DRS algorithm is not optimal, open a
  Rackspace Technology ticket and request a consultation.

Subject to a variety of conditions, you can complete vMotion either offline
or online. At a minimum, both source and destination hosts must have access
to the shared datastore(s) where the VMâ€™s vDisks are located. Open a ticket
and ask us for a consultation so that we can advise you about what is
possible based on your requirements.

The time required to execute a vMotion depends on the amount of vRAM
allocated to VM and the overall resource allocation. An online vMotion
might impact your environment.

To request a vMotion, open a Rackspace Technology ticket and specify
the following information:

* The VMs you want to migrate
* The source and destination ESXi hosts or vSphere clusters
* A timeframe for the migration
