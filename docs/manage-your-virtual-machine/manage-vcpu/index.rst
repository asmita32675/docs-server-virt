Manage vCPU
===========

It is important that you size the VM’s vCPU correctly. If you assign
too few vCPUs to a VM, the VM’s performance might suffer. If you assign
too many vCPUs to a VM, you might create CPU congestion on the hypervisor.
When you over-allocate vCPUs, the VM can unknowingly share vCPUs with
other VMs, and the Guest OS might misreport CPU-related metrics.

If you need guidance on how much vCPU to allocate, create
a Rackspace Technology support ticket that requests a vCPU consultation.
