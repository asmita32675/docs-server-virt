What is capacity planning?
==========================


As your business grows, so do your VMs. Although the resources that VMs
consume are finite, you can take some steps to anticipate need and plan
for future growth. Capacity planning is the process of reviewing the
resource usage of VMs and estimating their growth so that you can
proactively expand your physical resources before you need them.
Without capacity planning, you might not be able to build new VMs
or expand your existing VMs, and your environment might slow over time.

You are responsible for estimating your future growth needs, for example,
telling us how many new VMs you need and how many resources you expect
each of them to consume.

We can provide the details about current usage. Many metrics are already
available on the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal.

After you have existing data and future growth estimates, contact your
Rackspace Technology account team.
