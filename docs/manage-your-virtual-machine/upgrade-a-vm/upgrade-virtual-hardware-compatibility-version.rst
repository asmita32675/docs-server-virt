Upgrade virtual hardware compatibility version
==============================================


The virtual hardware compatibility version is the VM version that
specifies the ESXi host versions with which the VM is compatible.
VMs with newer virtual hardware compatibility versions have increased
limits for the virtual hardware you can allocate.

New virtual hardware compatibility versions are available with
new ESXi releases.

To request an upgrade to the virtual hardware compatibility version,
open a Rackspace Technology ticket and specify the VM you want to upgrade.
We work with you to schedule the upgrade.
