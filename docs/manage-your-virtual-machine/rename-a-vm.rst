===========
Rename a VM
===========

You can give your VM a meaningful name, which can be useful when you
re-purpose your VM.

VM names must begin with the Rackspace Technology device number,
a six- or seven-digit unique serial number. We require that naming
convention because it helps us quickly locate your VM and facilitates
the communication between you and us.

When you request a VM name change, we change it on all layers,
including the Guest OS hostname, the VMware container, and
the device name that appears in the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal.

To rename a VM, open a Rackspace Technology ticket and provide
the following information:

* Current VM name
* New VM name
