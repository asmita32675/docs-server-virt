Upgrade vRAM
============



If your VM consistently consumes all RAM resources and VM performance
suffers, the VM might benefit from additional vRAM.

Consider the following guidelines when you decide to add vRAM:

* Be careful when adding vRAM to your VM. The RAM resources ultimately come from the physical hardware, and if the hypervisor is already under pressure for RAM, adding RAM might not solve the problem.
* Only allocate as much vRAM as the VM needs.
* When the vRAM allocation approaches or exceeds the amount of physical RAM, the ESXi server invokes memory reclamation techniques, such as ballooning and swapping. Memory reclamation technologies enable slight over-allocation but can adversely affect the performance of the target VM and all other VMs on the hypervisor.
