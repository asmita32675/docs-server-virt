==========================
Change vSwap file location
==========================


So that the hypervisor can manage RAM contention, by default,
the hypervisor stores the VMâ€™s memory in a vSwap file located on
the same datastore as the VM. In most cases, the size of this file is
equal to the size of configured vRAM, unless vRAM is reserved.

If you think you want to change the vSwap file location, open a
Rackspace Technology ticket and request a consultation.
